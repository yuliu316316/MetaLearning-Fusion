This package contains the source code which is associated with the following paper:

Huafeng Li, Yueliang Cen, Yu Liu, Xun Chen, Zhengtao Yu, "Different Input Resolutions and Arbitrary Output Resolution: A Meta-Learning Based Deep Framework for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion", submitted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 2020. (under review, second round)

Edited by Yueliang Cen and Yu Liu.   

Usage of this code is free for research purposes only. 

The MLFusion model is learned by pytorch and then converted into a '.pth' file. The training code will be released if the paper could be accepted for publication. 

Thank you.
